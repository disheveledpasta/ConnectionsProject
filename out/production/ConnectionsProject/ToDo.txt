1. Finish first prototype, then analyze what to do. Likely involving the interface, more methods, and data persistence. <-- after current

2. System.out.println("List of commands:\n" + // commands list
                        "/connection (get/add/edit/remove/removeall)\n" +
                        "/property (get/add/edit/remove/removeall)\n" +
                        "/IDCard (create/remove)\n" +
                        "/IDTree\n");

3. Add editProperty(), editConnection(), and editConnectionProperty(). <-- current

4. Add a bunch of null checkers. <-- current

5. Perhaps make it so if ID Cards are removed, the next ID Card created can replace the now empty ID Number.

6. Reform variable names in the switch statement in IdentityCardManager

7. Add an option for reciprocated connections.
